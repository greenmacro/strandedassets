# Sensitivity Analysis

We are here in the case of a sensitivity analysis on both parameters, using the latin hypercube [TODO: add stuff about that, reference to Salle and Yildigluzu]. We run 33 models, using the design experiment within domain space $D:\theta \in [0,0.4] \times \phi [0.04]$. The parameters tested can be found in appendix.

This section analyses the effect of the two parameters on the following set of indicators which relates to the outcome of the transition:

- *exit period*: how long before the high-carbon sector exits the market 
- *real stranded assets*: value of the capital stock owned by the high-carbon sector in the period before the exit period
- *financial stranded assets*: market capitalisation of the high-carbon capital sector in the period before the exit period
- *output volatility*: defined as the sum of the coefficient of variation of each of the three sector real output

We use one lag values for the stranded asset because the exit period might be triggered by three different conditions: non-postive profit in the high-carbon sector, non-positive output in the high-carbon sector or non-positive price of high-carbon equity. 

Most of the sensitivity graphs (see hereunder) show that:
1. the apathy parameter dominates the effect of the blindness parameter for all the parameters but for the volatility indicator
2. that the larger the value of the $\theta$ parameter, the longer the transition lasts (up to the point where values of $\theta$ above 0.4 lead to no transition at all) and the more stranded assets there are, and
3. that there are non-linear effects emerging both along the values of the apathy parameter and along combined values of the two parameters.

In this domain exploration, 6 scenarios lead to no transition at all. This will be at the center of the analysis of the next section. It is worth noting that $\theta$ is not the only explanatory factor as the combination of specific values of the two parameters might lead to transition or no transition for values that are similar. This indicates that there are path dependency impacts and knife-edge dynamics at work. The specific impact of the blindness parameter, for a given level of apathy will be analysed in a following section.

Non linear impacts of the apathy parameter seem to start for value larger than $0.1$. This is confirmed by a sensitivity analysis (not shown) over the domain $(\theta,\phi)\in [0,0.1]$ which shows linear relationship for all indicator but the volatility one. 

The analysis hereunder will show that the non-linear behaviours is due to stock effects arising from financial apathy and blindness. In a nutshell, the portfolio specification leads to re-allocation between low-carbon and high-carbon sectors but also between capital and consumption sectors. This in turn triggers non-trivial impacts on investment, employment and hence total output, but also to the relative size of each sector. Each of the two recession phases (when the low-carbon ermerges in the capital good market and when it enters the financial market) have more or less pronounced effect depending on these relative sectorial size. In certain cases, the economy settles into low capital stock regime (due to the growth function), implying an already deflated capital stock into the high-carbon sector, which leads to a smoother transition.

## The case of no transition

This analysis compare the dynamics of the baseline scenario ($\theta=0, \,\phi=0$) with a case of no transition ($\theta=0.35, \, \phi=0.175$)

As soon as the low-carbon sector enters the capital good market (period 21), it starts eating market share to the high-carbon sector. By doing so, it impacts the high-carbon sector growth rate which should trigger a re-allocation from the high-carbon sector equities towards the consumption sector ones. With more apathetic and blinder financial investor, this does no happen. They give indeed more weight to what they think should be the level of capital stock in the high-carbon sector and hence inflate or deflate the expected present value of the high-carbon capital stock, leading to a different prices of equity for the high-carbon sector *and for the consumption sector*. Indeed, the low-carbon sector is not present on the financial market yet, but financial investor already start favouring the high-carbon sector due to their apathy and blindness. 

This leads to different growth rate in each sector, leading to different investment decision. Overall, the impact is positive in terms of output, employment and labor income. This dyanmic is reinforced as the observed growth rates feed into the financial appreciation of potential value for capital stocks. Furthermore, higher labor income leads to increased consumption and reverts the initial negative impact on the consumption sector.

Once this happens, the expected growth rate in the consumption sector takes over the expected growth rates in the high-carbon capital scetor and we observe a reversal of the trends due to financial re-allocation of funds: reduced (and eventually negative) growth in the capital sector, decrease in output and employment. Note that this has no effect on the low-carbon sector.

![GDP Components](plots/final/NoTransitionGDP.png)

The effect on the capital stock are more striking, more blindness leaves the economy with a lower capital stock in the high-carbon sector and in the consumption sector, as a result of the dynamics we described hereabove. 

![GDP Components](plots/final/NoTransitionKstock.png)

The Initial Public Offering (IPO, in period 41) of the low-carbon sector creates an important disruption to the financial market as part of the existing welath is removed from the two existing sectors to be allocated to the low-carbon sector. This leads to movements in equity prices, changes in Tobin's q values, wealth loss, consumption effect and growth effects.

Blinder and more apathetic financial investors imply behaviours such that part of the low-carbon growth is transfered to the capital good sector, leading to a much smaller shock (20% lower) to both the high-carbon capital sector *and the consumption sector*. Indeed as the expected present value of the low-carbon sector decreases, leading to an increase of the high-carbon sector, the expected present value of the consumption sector's capital stock remains proportionally higher. 

![GDP Components](plots/final/NoTransitionMarketCap.png)

This also implies  a much higher financial wealth and thus higher consumption. We thus observe a much milder recession after the IPO. The combination of the portfolio re-allocation and higher levels of GDP leads to a situation where the low-carbon sector doesn't grow as fast in the non-transition scenario as in the baseline case. On the other hand the high-carbon and consumption sector grow much faster.

# High-carbon bubble scenario

We now turn to the case of different blindness (i.e. different $\phi$) but identical apathy (same $\theta=0.2$). We compare scenario 34 (transition with a small High-Carbon bubble, $\phi=1$) and scenario 27 (transition with a large high-carbon bubble, $\phi=0.3$) of the Phi sensitivity analysis (33 scenarios combining $\theta \in \left\{0,0.1,0.2\right\}$ and  $\phi \in \left\{0,0.1,0.2,...,0.9,1\right\}$) . The success/fail caracteristics regards the existence of a large or small recession at the end of the transition, which takes place anyway.

As for the case of the no-transition scenario, the entry of the low-carbon sector lead to a re-allocation of financial assets which have an impact on the growth rate of consumption and high-carbon sectors. The following table shows the difference in expected present value and equity price due to higher blindness (positive value implies higher value in the blinder, more successful, case).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("PhiAnalysis.Rdata")
tempf<-fail[22:25,c("iiperc","kk","kkperc","PVyi","PVyk","pke","pce","gk","gc")]
temp<-suc[22:25,c("iiperc","kk","kkperc","PVyi","PVyk","pke","pce","gk","gc")]
dif<-100*round((temp-tempf)/temp,digit=5)
kable(cbind(dif))
```


As in the no-transition scenario analysis, a business cycle emerges as the increase in employment leads to increase in consumption, and an increase in the consumption sector capital stock. This reverses the portfolio allocation towards the consumption sector and leads to a decrease in the high-carbon investment strategy. The main difference lies in the magnitude of these cycles: blinder financial investor actually smooth the business cycle by discounting more of the green capital stock and thus over-valuing the high-carbon capital stock. This leads to less abrubt fluctuation. This is shown in the following figure displyaing the difference in GDP component between the two transitions (less blind values minus blinder values) as a percentage of current GDP. where we can see that blinder financial investor leads to much smaller GDP fluctuation, of the order of magnitue of up to 1% of GDP.

![GDP Components](plots/final/PhiGDP.png)

Again, the effect on the capital stock are striking, more blindness leaves the economy with a lower capital stock in the brown sector and a slightly higher capital stock in the consumption sector. Overall, the economy has a lower stock of capital.

![Physical Capital Stocks](plots/final/PhiCapstock.png)

Lower capital stock in the aggregate leads to lower debt level (given the targeted leverage level), implying that money holding by households is lower, but this is partially compensated by a higher level of total market capitalisation.

![Type of assets holding in the households sector](plots/final/PhiWealth.png)

Once the green sector enters the financial market, most of the dynamics are dominated by the portfolio re-allocation process and its feed-back to real dimensions such as growth, employment, consumption and investment. The fact that the brown capital sector was already smaller means that the shock of the green IPO is relatively lower, leading to a phase where total financial wealth is not as depressed as in the less-blind scenario. However, this is only transitory as soon the reality of real capital stock levels drags down the market capitalisation of all firms into level lower in the blinder case.

![GDP Components](plots/final/PhiMarketCap.png)

On the flow side, the situation pre-IPO remain the norm, i.e. lower consumption and overal lower investment in brown capital. The overall lower level even leads to lower green investment towards the end of the transition.

On the stock space, the level of capital stock remains slightly higher in the blinder scenario while the large gap in bropwn capital stock slowly disapears (due to lower decrease in capital stock than in the less-blind scenario). The observed decrease in green investment translates in a lower level of green capital stock.

When the brown sector defaults, the economy is thus in a situation where there is less capital stock, less debt and less financial assets in the brown capital sector. This imply that the disappearance of the high-carbon sector is less of a shock and hence allow for a quicker recovery afterwards. The following table shows the relative difference (in percentage) between the two scenario (negative value for lower value in the blinder scenario)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tempf<-fail[62,c("kk","Lk","pke")]
tempf$pke<-tempf$pke*50
temp<-suc[62,c("kk","Lk","pke")]
temp$pke<-temp$pke*50
dif<-100*round((temp-tempf)/temp,digit=5)
kable(cbind(dif),row.names = FALSE)
```

The interesting conclusion from this scenario analysis is that, as for the no-tranition scenario analysis, pre-IPO dynamics explain most of the reason for a difference in the amplitude of shock due to the default of the brown sector. The blindness parameter affects at first the consumption sector which launch the economy to a path including a lower level fo GDP and a lower level of stocks.
